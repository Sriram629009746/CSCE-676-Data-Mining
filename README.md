## Introduction
This repo contains course assignments of [CSCE-676 Data-Mining] at TAMU offered by Dr. James Caverlee during Spring 2022 semester.

## HW1 Exploratory Data Analysis | Association Rule Mining

- <b>HW1P1</b>
Collect UFO data from the web(http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlTX.html), clean it and then make some observations based on exploratory data analysis. 

- <b>HW1P2</b>
The task is to examine the movies dataset using our understanding of association rules, to find movies that "go together". 
Implement the apriori algorithm, and apply it to a movie rating dataset(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

## HW2 Twitter Data Mining using Spark
- <b>HW2P1</b>
Exploratory Data Analysis of tweets related to US Congress members using PySpark.

- <b>HW2P2</b>
Using PageRank(from Spark) to find the top Congress Members according to user mentions.

## HW3 Data Viz | Movie Recommender
- <b>HW3P1</b>
Bike Sharing dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. The task is to create some data visualization and find some interesting insights.

- <b>HW3P2</b>
Movie Rating Recommendation with explicit feedback on the MovieLens 1M dataset(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/). The main tasks are building a baseline estimation model, a collaborative filtering model and a matrix factorization model.

## HW4 Twitter Data Mining using Embeddings

- <b>HW4</b>
Data mining analysis using embeddings of the congressional Twitter dataset using embedding techniques like word2vec.
